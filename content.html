<p>
When i started learning English Higher Level i didn't have anything and let me not lie to you, i failed miserably<br> 
then i bought the two books; <b>CROCODILE BURNING</b> by <i>Michael Williams</i> and <b>"MASTER HAROLD"...and the boy</b>
 by <i>Athol Fugard</i>. <br>
After i got these two books with the help of my beautiful teacher <b>Mrs Masule Grace</b> . I got really better. I started
 passing very well.</p>
